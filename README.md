automatically with just one click. Users can assign tags to the notes and can search it accordingly.
Priority can be set to the notes and sorting of notes is done with the same. Background colour of the
notes is changed based on priority. Image can be associated with the note, which will be displayed to the user while
viewing the notes. With these features we try to make the use of a note app even more convenient
for the user.
